# Jeopardy-training

## Description 
At some point in my journey to become a full-stack web developer, i'ss likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize me with these tests and allow me to showcase the skills ive learned. In this assisnment i have to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
